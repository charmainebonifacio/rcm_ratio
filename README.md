# The Regional Climate Model (RCM) 

STEP 2. This python script will calculate the monthly ratios for each RCM grid that will be used in the downscaling technique.

## Context

The downscaling of the Regional Climate Model (RCM) data is required for it to be used an an input to the [ACRU - Agricultural Catchments Research Unit](http://unfccc.int/adaptation/nairobi_work_programme/knowledge_resources_and_publications/items/5299.php) MODEL. The RCM comes in 40 km spatial resolution. The spatial resolution required as an input is 10 km.

## Legacy

The purpose is to automate the downscaling procedure of the regional climate model data into a 10 km spatial resolution that will be applied to the ACRU MODEL.
